  <h1>Alex's Animal Sanctuary Ledger</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🌱 Purpose</h2>
    <p>This page exists to quietly record the progress of a dream — the creation of a sanctuary for animals in São Francisco do Glória, Minas Gerais, Brazil. It's not about fame. It's about healing, helping, and doing something real in a world that often feels upside down.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>📍 Location</h2>
    <p>Family farm in São Francisco do Glória, MG — Brazil (CEP 35352-000).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🧱 Phase 1: Online Foundation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>✓ Set up a private online ledger (this page)</li>
      <li>□ Begin income generation without showing face</li>
      <li>□ Save for basic tools: satellite internet, shelter, food, care</li>
      <li>□ Begin preparing land for safe spaces</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🐾 Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>Animals can't choose. People can. This sanctuary is a way to give a peaceful life to creatures who have only known suffering. Castration, rescue, shelter, and healing — all of it with love, honesty, and no tricks.</p>
