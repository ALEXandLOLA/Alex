# Sanctuary Ledger 🐾

**Dream:** Build a quiet, honest sanctuary in São Francisco do Glória, MG, Brazil — to protect, heal, and love animals who’ve been mistreated.

**Founder:** Just a person who cares deeply. No face, no fame — only action.

**Guiding Values:**
- No lies, no manipulation, no tricks.
- No fame, no public ego, just purpose.
- Only truth, kindness, and quiet, ongoing work.

**Goals:**
- Phase 1: Create a transparent, trust-based digital journal to track every dream step.
- Phase 2: Secure funding without asking for donations publicly.
- Phase 3: Build the sanctuary — tree by tree, animal by animal.

This is the beginning.
